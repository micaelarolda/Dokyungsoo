<h1>D.O Kyungsoo</h1>

<p><h2>He is polite</h2> <br>
Everyone who has worked with him has this to say about him:<br>. he’s well-mannered.<br>In fact, his politeness is evident from the way he bows –<br> which is one of the key indicators of one’s mannerisms in Korean culture.<br> The singer never fails to do 90-degree bows to fellow singers, and even the audience, at the end of each performance.</p>
<p><h3>He is a gentleman</h3><br>
Yes, we might be advocates of gender equality, but we also think chivalry is not dead.<br> The idol embodies this trait, as seen by the way he treats his female co-stars.<br> He allows them to go up and leave the stage first,<br> and even stands at the side to guide them down, especially when they’re wearing high heels.<br> At times, he would even lend a helping hand, <br>like lifting a girl’s dress trail to ensure she doesn’t trip.</p>
<p><h6>He has a dark side</h6> <br>
Kyungsoo seems to have a high tolerance for nonsense (we wonder how he survives his members’ incessant teasings),<br> but he doesn’t hesitate to shoot death glares or even hit those who cross the line.<br> One of his most famous outbursts has got to be when he threatened to kill everyone <br> when the members and fans forced him do “aegyo” (or act cute) during a concert.</p>
<p><h7>He acts well</h7> <br>
One of the more successful cases of idol-turned-actor,<br> Kyungsoo has wowed not only his fans, but also critics with his acting chops.<br> Unlike a few other members who had formal acting training at SM Entertainment, the singer had none – he relied on hard work and picked up skills on the sets and through watching movies.<br> Impressive!</p>
<p><h8>His vocals are amazing </h8><br>
He undoubtedly has one of the best vocals in EXO and dare we say,the whole of K-pop.<br> His smooth vocals are suitable not only for R&B numbers, but also ballads and pop songs.<br> The versatile singer also has impeccable pronunciation in foreign languages,<br> which makes him sound like a native regardless of which language he sings in.</p>
<p><h9>He’s pretty good at dancing</h9><br>
Yes, he might pale in comparison beside the main dancers of EXO,<br> Kai, Lay and Sehun, but he does a decent job in executing the group’s dance choreography.<br> But we gotta admit, he can’t do freestyle.</p>
<p><h10>He acts cute without realising it</h10><br>
He’s not the kind of person who would “act cute” as fan service – in fact,<br> he hates it – but he ends up looking adorable no matter what he does.</p>
<p><h11>He’s a go-getter</h11><br>
When he wants something, he puts his heart and soul into it. <br>And we’re not just talking about acting.<br> About two years ago, he announced on a show that he’s exercising to broaden his shoulders.<br> Now, he’s all buffed up with broad shoulders.<br> Look at the difference he made after a few months of working out!</p>
<p><h12>He makes witty remarks</h12> <br>
<Unlike Baekhyun whose witty remarks make everyone double over in laughter,<br> Kyungsoo’s come in the form of comebacks. <br>And sometimes, he gives the best reaction ever – no reaction, which makes the members squirm in discomfort.</p>
<p><h13>He looks adorable when eating</h13><br>
Have you seen him eat? <br>Look at these gifs and tell us he doesn’t look adorable.</p>
